        Hometown [dis]Advantage is a visual artist living and creating in
        Chicago. These creations focus on distilling imagery to a bold, base
        form and draw influence from sources like ritualistic iconography,
        traditional tattoo flash, camp aesthetic, and the city he calls home.

        For real though, Hometown [dis]Advantage is an ongoing (and forever)
        stream of content, nothing more nothing less. The face continually
        changes but the bone structureâ€™s never moved an inch.

        Surrounded by technology and strangers ya heard, that's why I got a
        website.
